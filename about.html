        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Connor Rhyne, an Information Security Analyst with a passion for technology, cybersecurity, and leadership. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Technology Management with minors in Cybersecurity and Business at Texas A&M University, I thrive at the intersection of technology, security, and business operations. With a strong foundation in both technical expertise and soft skills, I excel in high-pressure situations, consistently achieving results by leveraging my academic background and professional experiences to solve complex challenges and drive meaningful outcomes.</p>

    <section id="MyJourney">
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>Since 2021, I have immersed myself in the world of technology and cybersecurity. My academic journey includes coursework in Unix System Administration, Applied Digital Forensics, Business Relationship Management, and more. These classes have equipped me with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on skills.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I’ve climbed the ranks at Texas A&M University Technology Services, starting as a Technician and advancing to IT Manager and now Information Security Analyst. These roles have allowed me to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Lead teams of 60 technicians, ensuring efficiency and excellence in technical support:</strong> As an IT Manager at Texas A&M University Technology Services, I successfully coordinated a team of 60 technicians, overseeing their daily operations and ensuring timely resolution of support tickets. By implementing streamlined workflows, providing ongoing training, and fostering a collaborative team environment, I improved customer satisfaction rates and operational efficiency. My leadership emphasized accountability, skill development, and adaptability in a fast-paced technical support environment.</li>
				<li><strong>Perform in-depth incident investigations to bolster organizational security:</strong> In my role as an Information Security Analyst, I conducted comprehensive investigations into security incidents, analyzing logs, network activity, and system behaviors to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats. By delivering assumption-free technical reports with actionable insights, I expedited response times and enhanced organizational awareness of security risks. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of cybersecurity principles, including computer networking, digital forensics, and proactive defense strategies.</li>
				<li><strong>Enhance communication between technical teams through detailed documentation:</strong> I prioritized creating clear, concise, and thorough documentation of incidents, investigations, and resolutions to improve cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing. By standardizing reporting practices, I bridged communication gaps between security, IT support, and management teams. This documentation played a pivotal role in long-term strategy development, compliance adherence, and the continuous improvement of security measures.</li>
			</ul>

        <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
        <p>I’ve had the privilege of collaborating on impactful academic and professional projects that showcase my ability to analyze complex challenges, design innovative solutions, and deliver results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Instructional Design Project:</strong> Leveraging the Dick and Carey model, I conducted a detailed front-end analysis to identify gaps between desired and actual performance within a theoretical company. This analysis informed the creation of an instructional goal and a personalized training module aimed at improving employee performance and engagement. The project involved designing an interactive learning experience tailored to the unique needs of employees, including a step-by-step instructional strategy and a fully developed learning module.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Capstone – Optimizing Business Process Workflow & Risk Management:</strong> As part of a multidisciplinary team, I played a key role in analyzing and enhancing compliance and risk management processes for AgriLife's ARCMTS business operations. This involved conducting a comprehensive risk analysis to identify vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact. I collaborated with my team to design detailed process improvement diagrams, integrating compliance checkpoints and aligning them with organizational goals and regulatory standards. Our final deliverable included an actionable report presented to stakeholders, providing targeted recommendations to enhance data security, reduce risk exposure, and streamline business operations.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>These projects highlight my ability to tackle real-world challenges, apply systematic methodologies, and deliver meaningful solutions. I invite you to explore my Projects Page for a deeper dive into these and other initiatives that demonstrate my expertise and passion for problem-solving.</p>

        <h2>Leadership and Community</h2>
        <p>Leadership and service are core principles that guide my professional and personal life.
